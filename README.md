# NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Analysis
This is an analysis of NYPD shooting incident data for incidents that occurred in NYC from 2006 through the end of 2022. The data is provided by the NYPD and available for use by the public.
It can be found at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8.
Each record represents a shooting in NYC and includes information about the event, location, and the date/time. Also, information about the gender, age, and race of the victim and suspect is included.
I did an analysis to see how the number of shootings changes over the years. I also looked to see if the number of shootings that occurred differed based on the month and the time of day.
Finally, I looked at which Borough is the most dangerous by looking at which Borough had the most shootings and the highest shooting rate.
